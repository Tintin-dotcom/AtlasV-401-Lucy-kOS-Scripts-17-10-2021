This is the Kerbal Operating System code for an Atlas V 401 rocket launch carrying the Lucy Spacecraft to a solar orbit.

It includes a second file, which is a boot file and has to be placed inside a directory called "Boot", inside the /KSP/Ships/Script directory.

The code launches the rocket, performs the gravity turn, separates the stages and the payload fairing ejects the payload into an escape trajectory and deploys Lucy's instruments.

The boot.ks file opens the kOS Terminal of the the vessel directly after launch. This only works if you right-click the kOS-processor located at the top of the probe's tank and select boot file "boot.ks".
